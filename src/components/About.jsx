            I'm Gaurav Kumar, a passionate full-stack developer
            focused on building dynamic and impactful web experiences. From intuitive frontends with React
            and Next.js to powerful backends using Node.js.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy turning complex challenges into
            clean, efficient solutions. Outside of coding, I'm a curious learner who enjoys exploring new
            ideas and technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            I believe great development blends creativity with logicâ€”and I aim to bring both
            to every project I work on. Every day is a chance to learn, build, and create something
            meaningful.
